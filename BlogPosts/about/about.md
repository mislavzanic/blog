Hello, my name is Mislav Žanić.
I'm a DevOps engineer and a Software engineer wannabe.

I enjoy hacking and breaking mini coding projects (like this webpage and blog engine :D), doing coding puzzles (like Advent of Code), bouldering and reading classic novels (my favourite The Count of Monte Cristo).

If you want to contact me, please email me at [mislavzanic3@gmail.com](mailto:mislavzanic3@gmail.com).
