Hello there :D.
Welcome to my blog! This is my first post on this blog (hence the title).
In this post, I'll talk about the purpose of this blog.

![Hello There!](/blog/images/hello-there.jpg "Hello There :D")

## Goals
This blog has two main purposes. 
The first one is to teach me how to write better posts and reviews. As you will see, I am pretty bad at expressing myself in writing, and I plan on getting better at it!
The second one is to create a centralized place for me to document my tinkering, projects, and general "hacking & breaking" and for my CV.

## Posts
As I said previously, I'll be writing mostly about my tinkering adventures. 
I use [NixOs](https://nixos.wiki/) as my main driver with [XMonad](https://xmonad.org/) as a window manager, so my tinkering mostly boils down to these two.
I also like writing programs in [Go](https://go.dev/) (this post is rendered in the blog engine I wrote in Go) and solving an occasional programming puzzle (e.g. [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)) so I'll write about that also. 

I hope that my blabbering and misadventures are interesting or helpful to some of you :).
