I've been working with NixOS a lot for the last few months. 
I've moved this host to NixOS and created a VPN using NixOS (turns out that installing NixOS on random machines is fun).

I became bored with those machines since then (they are still useful, there's just not much tinkering to do on them), so I decided to buy myself a router and install NixOS on it (what could possibly go wrong...).

## The router

The router itself is an APU.2E4 board with a wle600vx wireless module.
I bought this board because I've heard it's great for beginner custom routers.
